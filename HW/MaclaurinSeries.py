# (i) Prove that this Maclaurin series expansion is a special case of the Taylor series expansion
#    (Eq. (4.7)in text) with xi =0 and h=x.



# (ii) Use a Taylor series to estimate f(x) = e−x at xi+1 = 2 for xi = 1.5. 
#   Employ the zero-,
#               first-, 
#               second-, 
#               and third-order
#        versions and compute |εt| for each case.
